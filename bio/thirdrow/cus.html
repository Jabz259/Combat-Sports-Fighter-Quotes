                            Constantine "Cus" D'Amato (January 17, 1908 – November 4, 1985) was an American boxing manager and trainer who handled
                            the careers of Mike Tyson, Floyd Patterson, and José Torres, all of whom went on to be inducted into the International
                            Boxing Hall of Fame. Several successful boxing trainers, including Teddy Atlas and Kevin Rooney, were tutored by
                            D'Amato. He was a proponent of the peek-a-boo style of boxing, in which the fighter holds his gloves close to his cheeks
                            and pulls his arms tight against his torso, which was criticized by some because it was believed that an efficient
                            attack could not be launched from it.
                            
                            Constantine D'Amato was born into an Italian-American family in the New York City borough of the Bronx on January 17,
                            1908, to Damiano (1868–1938) and Elisabetta (née Rosato; 1875–1913). Both his parents were from Toritto, province
                            of Bari, Southern Italy, Region Puglia. His father delivered ice and coal in the Bronx using a horse and cart. He had
                            three brothers, Rocco, Gerry, and Tony. At a young age, D'Amato became very involved and interested in Catholicism, and
                            even considered becoming a priest during his youth.
                            
                            He had a brief career as an amateur boxer, fighting as a featherweight and lightweight, but was unable to get a
                            professional license because of an eye injury he had suffered in a street fight. Cus stated in an interview that he did
                            not hold any grudges towards his father for the childhood abuse, as he believed the beatings made him a better and a
                            more disciplined man.
                            
                            At age 22, D'Amato opened the Empire Sporting Club with Jack Barrow at the Gramercy Gym. He lived in the gym for
                            years. According to D'Amato, he spent his time at the gym waiting for a "champion", but his best fighters were routinely
                            poached by "connected" managers. One fighter discovered by D'Amato was Italian-American Rocky Graziano, who signed with
                            other trainers and managers and went on to become middleweight champion of the world. D'Amato also confronted boxing
                            politics and decided, along with his friend Howard Cosell, to thwart the International Boxing Club of New York (IBC).
                            Suspicious to the point of paranoia, he refused to match his fighter in any bout promoted by the IBC. The IBC was
                            eventually found to be in violation of anti-trust laws and was dissolved.
