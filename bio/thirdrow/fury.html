                            As an amateur, he won a bronze medal at the 2006 World Junior Championships; gold at the 2007 EU Junior Championships;
                            silver at the 2007 European Junior Championships; and won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008. At regional level, he
                            has held multiple heavyweight championships, including the British title twice between 2011 and 2015; the European title
                            from 2014 to 2015; and the Commonwealth title from 2011 to 2012.
                            
                            In 2015, his victorious fight against Wladimir Klitschko was named Upset of the Year and earned him Fighter of the Year

                            Year by The Ring. In 2020, with his defeat of Deontay Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson
                            and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and was widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal
                            heavyweight champion. In 2021, his trilogy fight against Wilder was named Fight of the Year by The Ring.
