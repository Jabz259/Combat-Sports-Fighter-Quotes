                            William Harrison "Jack" Dempsey (June 24, 1895 â€“ May 31, 1983), nicknamed Kid Blackie and The Manassa Mauler, was an
                            American professional boxer who competed from 1914 to 1927, and reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1919 to
                            1926. A cultural icon of the 1920s, Dempsey's aggressive fighting style and exceptional punching power made him one
                            of the most popular boxers in history. Many of his fights set financial and attendance records, including the
                            first million-dollar gate. He pioneered the live broadcast of sporting events in general, and boxing matches in
                            particular.
                            
                            Dempsey is ranked sixth on The Ring magazine's list of all-time heavyweights and fourth among its Top 100 Greatest
                            Punchers, while in 1950 the Associated Press voted him as the greatest fighter of the past 50 years. He is a member
                            of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and was in the previous Boxing Hall of Fame.
