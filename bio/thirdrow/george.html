                            George Edward Foreman (born January 10, 1949) is an American former professional boxer, entrepreneur, minister,
                            and author. In boxing, he competed between 1967 and 1997 and was nicknamed "Big George". He is a two-time world
                            heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist. As an entrepreneur, he is known for the George Foreman Grill.
                            
                            After a troubled childhood, Foreman took up amateur boxing and won a gold medal in the heavyweight division at the 1968
                            Summer Olympics. Having turned professional the next year, he won the world heavyweight title with a stunning
                            second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in 1973. He defended the belt twice before suffering his first
                            professional loss to Muhammad Ali in the iconic Rumble in the Jungle in 1974. Unable to secure another title
                            opportunity, Foreman retired after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977.
                            
                            Following what he referred to as a born again experience, Foreman became an ordained Christian minister. Ten years
                            later he announced a comeback, and in 1994 at age 45 won the unified WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight championship
                            titles by knocking out 26-year-old Michael Moorer. He dropped the WBA belt rather than face his mandatory title defense
                            soon after, and following a single successful title defense against Axel Schulz, Foreman relinquished his IBF title as
                            well on June 28, 1995. At 46 years and 169 days old, he was the oldest world heavyweight champion in history. Foreman
                            is the oldest to ever win the world heavyweight boxing championship of major honors and the second-oldest in any weight
                            class after Bernard Hopkins (at light heavyweight). He retired in 1997 at the age of 48, with a final record of 76 wins
                            (68 knockouts) and 5 losses.
                            
                            Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and International Boxing Hall of Fame. The International
                            Boxing Research Organization rates Foreman as the eighth-greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2002, he was named one
                            of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring. The Ring ranked him as the ninth-greatest puncher of
                            all time. He was a ringside analyst for HBO's boxing coverage for 12 years until 2004. Outside boxing, he is a
                            successful entrepreneur and known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill, which has sold more than 100 million
                            units worldwide. In 1999, he sold the commercial rights to the grill for $138 million.
