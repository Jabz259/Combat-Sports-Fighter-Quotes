                            Khabib Abdulmanapovich Nurmagomedov[a] (born 20 September 1988) is a Russian former professional mixed martial artist
                            who competed in the Lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He was the longest-reigning UFC
                            Lightweight Champion ever, having held the title from April 2018 to March 2021. With 29 wins and no losses, he retired
                            with an undefeated record. Nurmagomedov is widely considered to be among the greatest mixed martial artists of all
                            time, and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on June 30, 2022.
                            
                            A two-time world champion in combat sambo, Nurmagomedov has a background in wrestling, judo, and sambo. Nurmagomedov was
                            ranked #1 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings at the time of his retirement, until being removed following his
                            title vacation in March 2021. Fight Matrix ranks him as the #1 lightweight of all time. In 2019, Forbes ranked
                            Nurmagomedov as the No. 1 most successful Russian athlete; Nurmagomedov also topped the list of the 40 most successful
                            Russian show business and sports personalities under 40.
                            
                            Nurmagomedov is also a mixed martial arts trainer and promoter, known for founding Eagles MMA and promoting the Eagle
                            Fighting Championship (EFC). After retirement, he transitioned to being a full-time coach and cornerman before retiring
                            from the sport completely in January 2023.
