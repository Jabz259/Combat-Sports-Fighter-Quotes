                            Anderson da Silva (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈɐ̃deʁsõ ˈsiwvɐ]; born 14 April 1975) is a Brazilian mixed martial
                            artist and professional boxer. He is a former UFC Middleweight Champion and holds the record for the longest title
                            reign in UFC history at 2,457 days. This started in 2006 and ended in 2013 and included a UFC record 16 consecutive
                            victories in that span. Silva left the UFC in November 2020 and returned to boxing.
                            
                            UFC president Dana White, UFC commentator Joe Rogan and numerous mixed martial arts (MMA) pundits have named Silva as
                            one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. Silva was inducted into the UFC Hall of
                            Fame in July 2023.

                            The son of a poverty-stricken family, he spent the majority
                            of his childhood in Curitiba with his aunt and uncle, who was an officer with the Curitiba police force. Silva's
                            first foray in martial arts began as a child training jiu-jitsu with neighborhood kids. As a teen, Silva began training
                            in taekwondo, capoeira and muay thai.
