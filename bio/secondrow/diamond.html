                            Dustin Glenn Poirier (born January 19, 1989) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He competes in the
                            Lightweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is a former Interim UFC Lightweight Champion.
                            Poirier also challenged three times for the UFC Lightweight Championship and once for the BMF title. As of April 16,
                            2024, he is #4 in the UFC lightweight rankings. Poirier was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, and is of Cajun heritage.[8] He attended Northside High School for a short
                            time, but he dropped out in the ninth grade because of repeatedly getting into trouble and street fight.
                            Poirier turned professional in 2009, quickly compiled a record of 7â€“0, competing mostly in regional promotions across
                            his native Louisiana and the Southern United States. Glimpses of Poirier's early MMA career in Louisiana are depicted in
                            the documentary Fightville.
