                            Jonathan Dwight Jones (born July 19, 1987)[2] is an American professional mixed martial artist signed to the Ultimate
                            Fighting Championship (UFC), where he is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion. A professional competitor since 2008,
                            Jones was previously the UFC Light Heavyweight Champion from 2011 to 2015 and from 2018 to 2020, as well as the interim
                            UFC Light Heavyweight Champion in 2016. As of July 2, 2024, he is #3 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. He
                            is regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time.
                            
                            Jones became the youngest champion in UFC history with his title victory over Maur√≠cio Rua at age 23. He holds many
                            UFC records in the light heavyweight division, including the most title defenses, most wins, and longest win streak.
                            During much of his championship reign, Jones has been widely considered to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the
                            world. Never stopped nor outscored during his career, Jones's only professional loss is a
                            controversial disqualification against Matt Hamill; a result disputed by Hamill and UFC president Dana
                            White.
                            
                            Between 2015 and 2017, Jones was involved in several controversies and lost his title three times as a result of
                            disciplinary action. He was first stripped of his title and removed from the official rankings by the UFC in 2015 after
                            he was arrested on felony hit-and-run charges. His subsequent returns to the UFC in 2016 and 2017 saw him emerge
                            victorious in title bouts against Ovince Saint Preux and Daniel Cormier, but were both cut short by Jones testing
                            positive for banned substances and receiving further suspensions, with the latter reversed to a no contest.
                            After his 2017 suspension was lifted, Jones reclaimed the championship in 2018 by defeating Alexander Gustafsson. He
                            voluntarily vacated the title in 2020 and spent three years away from MMA before returning in 2023 to win the UFC
                            Heavyweight Championship against Ciryl Gane.
