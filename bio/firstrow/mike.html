                            Michael Gerard Tyson (born June 30, 1966) is an American professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2005, and is
                            scheduled to compete once again in 2024. Nicknamed "Iron Mike" and "Kid Dynamite" in his early career, and later
                            known as "the Baddest Man on the Planet", Tyson is regarded as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time.
                            He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by
                            knockout, 12 of them in the first round. Claiming his first belt at 20 years, 4 months, and 22 days old, Tyson holds the
                            record as the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously
                            hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, as well as the only heavyweight to unify them in succession. The following year, Tyson
                            became the lineal champion when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round. In 1990, Tyson was
                            knocked out by underdog Buster Douglas in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.
                            
                            In 1992, Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison. He was released on parole after three
                            years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights, regaining the WBA and WBC titles in
                            1996 to join Floyd Patterson, Muhammad Ali, Tim Witherspoon, Evander Holyfield and George Foreman as the only men in
                            boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after losing it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the
                            same year, Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh round stoppage. Their 1997 rematch ended when
                            Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears, one bite notoriously being strong enough to remove a portion of his
                            right ear. In 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title, losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis.
