                            Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016) was an
                            American
                            professional boxer and activist. Nicknamed "the Great", he is regarded as one of the most
                            significant sports figures
                            of the 20th century and is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. He
                            held
                            the Ring magazine
                            heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970. He was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978 and
                            the
                            WBA and Ring heavyweight
                            champion from 1978 to 1979. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports
                            Illustrated
                            and the Sports
                            Personality of the Century by the BBC. Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began
                            training as an amateur boxer at
                            age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer
                            Olympics
                            and turned professional
                            later that year. He converted to Islam after 1961. He won the world heavyweight
                            championship,
                            defeating Sonny Liston in
                            a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he denounced his birth name
                            as
                            a "slave name" and
                            formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. In 1967, Ali refused to be drafted into the
                            military,
                            owing to his religious
                            beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, and was found guilty of draft evasion and
                            stripped of his boxing
                            titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his
                            conviction was overturned
                            in 1971. He did not fight for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an
                            athlete. Ali's actions as a
                            conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture of
                            the
                            1960s generation, and he
                            was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights
                            movement and throughout his
                            career. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam
                            (NOI).
                            He later disavowed the
                            NOI, adhering to Sunni Islam.
